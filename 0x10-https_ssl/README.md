0x10. HTTPS SSL
A secure connection between a client and a server is established using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security).

SSL creates a secure tunnel and all data that travels through this tunnel is encrypted. The two parties must authenticate each other using digital certificates.

SSL is now deprecated and has been replaced by TLS, which is the new industry standard for secure connections.

TLS is backward compatible with SSL, and is based on SSL 3.0. Most web browsers still refer to the protocol as SSL. However, the protocol is now officially known as TLS.
